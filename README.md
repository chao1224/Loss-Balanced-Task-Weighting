The figshare appendix is public [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7732964).

This repository implements several multi-task learning algorithms, including the Loss-Balanced Task Weighting (LBTW) approach.
LBTW dynamically sets tasks weights while training a multi-task neural network.

### Setup

+ [Anaconda2-4.3.1](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh)
+ PyTorch=0.3
+ scikit-learn=0.19

### Datasets

Randomly split PubChem BioAssay (PCBA) [1] into 5 folds.
PCBA has 128 binary classification tasks.

### Experiments

+ 128 Single-Task Learning (STL).
+ 1 Multi-Task Learning (MTL).
+ 128 Fine-Tuning.
+ 2 GradNorm [2].
+ 1 RMTL [3].
+ 2 Loss-Balanced Task Weighting (LBTW).
